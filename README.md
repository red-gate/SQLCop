# SQLCop

Welcome to the SQL Cop repository!

These are a set of tSQLt tests designed to allow you to detect common problems in your database, originally maintained by George Mastros on LessThanDot.

This project is now managed by SQLServerCentral and Redgate Software. Steve Jones is the primary contact, but all updates and contributions are welcome by pull request. If you submit a contribution, please include reasons why the changes are helpful to most users of the project.

## Requirements

This project requires the [tsqlt framework](https://tsqlt.org/) to run the tests. All SQL Server versions that support the SQLCLR can use these tests. Please check the tsqlt requirements for your system.

**NOTE** : These Tests are NOT suitable for production databases

## Installing the tests

All tests are created as stored procedures in a test class (schema), called SQLCop. You can compile them in a SQL Server database and use the tsql.run command to execute any of these tests.
